1.create repository
(mkdir )
cd the 
pwd-demonstrate the content
git init
2.add the file
git add readme.txt
(git add file1.txt
 git add file2.txt file3.txt)
git commit -m"wrote a readme file"
3.trace the modify
git status -- get the status
git diff filename before commit
cat filename --scan the file
4.version rollback
git log (filename) --review the history 
git reset --hard Head^(or one ID)
!!只针对于修改，不针对于文件
！！！Why git is more excellent than others is that Git is tracing and managing the modifies. 

5.unstage modify
5.1 if you modify the file and you has not added to the staging area, you can use--
git status
will see 
$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   gitStudy.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
git checkout -- file
5.2 if you has already added to the staging area,you should use 
git status,will see 
$ git status
On branch mastergit 
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   gitStudy.txt

git reset HEAD file
$ git reset HEAD gitStudy.txt
Unstaged changes after reset:
M       gitStudy.txt

the file will not be modified,but it will not in the staging area.
6. delete file
rm file
git status but it is there in version repository
so you can use git rm to delete the file or use git checkout to unstage the delete operation

7.remote repository
7.1 create .ssh
ssh-kengen -t rsa -C"email address"
the ssh-rsa will be added to C:/Users/38513/.ssh by default
register you account in the https://github.com
in your account,add the ssh_rsa_id_pub
7.2 native to remote
create a new repository by default
git remote add origin git@github.com:NewRoad2017/git/git.git 
git remote add origin https://github.com/NewRoad2017/git.git adopt in windows
in the first time 
git push -u origin master
in the second time and so one
git push origin master
7.3 remoto to native
create a new repository with README.txt
then write clone command in the native  
git clone https://github.com/NewRoad2017/git.git
8.branch management
8.1 create branch and switch to branch and work

git checkout -b branchName
...git branch branchName
...git checkout branchName
// look up the branchs
git branch
// swich to another branch
git checkout branchName
// merge the branch to the master
git merge branchName
 delete the branch
git branch -d branchName
facilitate using the brach to complete the work

8.2 solve conflict
each should have add and commit
8.3 the strategy of branch management
git merge --no-ff -m"merge with no-ff" br2
git log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
8.4 bug branch
you can use 
get stash 之后再开始进行工作
get stash list
...get stash apply
...get stash drop
then 
git stash pop

Feature branch
when it is not to merge ,just to delete -d or -D
